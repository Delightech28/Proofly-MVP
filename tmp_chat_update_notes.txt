Planned changes to Chat.jsx:
- Update `conversations` entries for users Sarah, Mike, Emma, Alex to match user-provided real data (timestamps, lastMessage, unreadCount, isTyping).
- Update `messages` object entries for conversation IDs 1-4 to ensure their message arrays include the listed messages with matching timestamps.
- Keep AI assistant (id 0) messages instant; keep AI pinned.
- No UI structure changes beyond data updates.

Will apply as direct edit to src/components/Chat.jsx.
